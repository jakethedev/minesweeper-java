## Minesweeper clone in Java

This project is just an archive to mark off the first
game I ever finished in the state it was in when
completed. The code is a mess, and I'd clean it up if
I didn't have other priorities - code was complete at
the end of 2014, and so it shall stay, a monument to
games and constant improvement

Simply a minesweeper clone, nothing more. The game is
feature complete, and operates just like the classic
Minesweeper, but in Java form with pure Java swing
UI components. Ew, I know, but it was fun, plays well,
and looks decent if you didn't hate the 90's

The only really interesting code here is the reveal
algorithm in MinesweeperPanel. If I had the luxury of
some time to burn, I'd clean it up and refactor it
to have a separation of concerns. There is no reason
for all the logic to be in a panel class other than
the 'I have a few hours to kill, lets write a game'
mentality that I had at the time.

I believe the bomb graphics are fan-made graphics in
the likeness of Nintendo's bob-omb character.
